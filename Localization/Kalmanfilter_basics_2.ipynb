    "**1st Law**:\n",
    "The belief representing the state $x_{t}$, is conditioned on all past states, measurements and controls. This can be shown mathematically by the conditional probability shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(x_{t} | x_{0:t-1},z_{1:t-1},u_{1:t})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "1) $z_{t}$ represents the **measurement**\n",
    "\n",
    "2) $u_{t}$ the **motion command**\n",
    "\n",
    "3) $x_{t}$ the **state** (can be the position, velocity, etc) of the robot or its environment at time t.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'If we know the state $x_{t-1}$ and $u_{t}$, then knowing the states $x_{0:t-2}$, $z_{1:t-1}$ becomes immaterial through the property of **conditional independence**'. The state $x_{t-1}$ introduces a conditional independence between $x_{t}$ and $z_{1:t-1}$, $u_{1:t-1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the law now holds as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(x_{t} | x_{0:t-1},z_{1:t-1},u_{1:t})=p(x_{t} | x_{t-1},u_{t})$$\n",

    "**2nd Law**:\n",

    "\n",
    "$x_{t}$ is **complete** means that the past states, controls or measurements carry no additional information to predict future.\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_{0:t-1}$, $z_{1:t-1}$ and $u_{1:t}$ are **conditionally independent** of $z_{t}$ given $x_{t}$ of complete.\n",

    "$\\bullet$  $p(x_{t} | x_{t-1},u_{t})\\rightarrow $**State Transition Probability**\n",

The belief, $\\overline{bel}(x_t)$, is **before** incorporating measurement($z_{t}$) at time t=t. This is the step where the motion occurs and information is lost because the means and covariances of the gaussians are added. The RHS of the equation incorporates the law of total probability for prior calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\rightarrow$ This is the **Correction** or update step that calculates the belief of the robot **after** taking into account the measurement($z_{t}$) at time t=t. This is where we incorporate the sensor information for the whereabouts of the robot. We gain information here as the gaussians get multiplied here. (Multiplication of gaussian values allows the resultant to lie in between these numbers and the resultant covariance is smaller.\n"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The robot now moves forward. This is the prediction step and the motion causes the robot to lose some of the information and hence the variance of the gaussians increase (diagram 4.). The final belief is **convolution** of posterior from previous step and the current state after motion. Also, the means shift on the right due to the motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Again, incorporating the measurement, the sensor senses a door and this time too the possibility of door is equal for the three door. This is where the filter's magic kicks in. For the final belief (diagram 5.), the posterior calculated after sensing is mixed or **convolution** of previous posterior and measurement. It improves the robot's belief at location near to the second door. The variance **decreases** and **peaks**.\n",
