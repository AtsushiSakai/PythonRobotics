Dear AtsushiSakai, <br>WE found your project from google when first searching for a rosbag to csv converter. We are a small team in MCity working on Connected (and Automated) vehicles. We are working with an opensource platform that serve as the AI to control the vehicle. Your code and documentation helped us a lot! <br> <br>Thank you! Have a nice day!

Dear Atsushi Sakai, <br> <br>With your simplistic descriptions in text and as gifs, i was able to help my students understand easily and effectively, I would be honored to help, in anyway towards this, As a hobbyist have been developing lidar based slam navigation systems from 2011 and its only right to acknowledge and thank you for your contributions.
