Dear AtsushiSakai, <br>thank you for building this cool repo for robotics. <br>I am still learning robotics and this will give me a good starting point. <br>I hope this note gets to you. <br> <br>

Dear AtsushiSakai, <br>WE found your project from google when first searching for a rosbag to csv converter. We are a small team in MCity working on Connected (and Automated) vehicles. We are working with an opensource platform that serve as the AI to control the vehicle. Your code and documentation helped us a lot! <br> <br>Thank you! Have a nice day!

Dear Atsushi Sakai, <br> <br>With your simplistic descriptions in text and as gifs, i was able to help my students understand easily and effectively, I would be honored to help, in anyway towards this, As a hobbyist have been developing lidar based slam navigation systems from 2011 and its only right to acknowledge and thank you for your contributions.

Dear Atsushi Sakai <br>I first came across your Matlab repository on ICP and SLAM. The repository for both python and Matlab helped me in understanding the essential concepts of robotics.I am really grateful to you for helping me develop my understanding of the concepts of robotics.

Dear AtshshiSakai, <br>You are very wise and smart that you created this library for students wanting to learn Probabilistic Robotics and actually perform robot control. <br>Hats off to you and your work. <br>I am also reading your book titled : Python Robotics

--Himanshu

Hi AtsushiSakai, <br> <br>Thanks for creating the pythonrobotics repo! It's an awesome repo that has been of great help to me. I've referenced your extended kalman filter algorithm while creating my own for localization using a 2D lidar, camera, and IMU. Our robot is destined to compete soon, so fingers crossed that all works out! Thanks again.

You rock!

Dear AtsushiSakai, <br>You are the best. This is by far the best tutorial for learning and implementing robotics. <br>Thanks a lot for your time and efforts to do this!

--Adi B

Dear Atushi, thank you for this amazing repository. It is a pleasure to have access to python algorithms without the burden of ROS. While I'm no longer working on such robotics projects, it's wonderful to know its available when I need it and it was amazing to see all the beautiful animations for each algorithm.
