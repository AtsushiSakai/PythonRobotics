## WHILL MODEL CR with move to a pose control

This is an electric wheelchair control demo by [Katsushun89](https://github.com/Katsushun89).

[WHILL Model CR](https://whill.jp/model-cr) is the control target, [M5Stack](https://m5stack.com/) is used for the controller, and [toio](https://toio.io/) is used for the control input device.

[move-to-a-pose-control](https://pythonrobotics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/path_tracking.html#move-to-a-pose-control) is used for its control algorithm ([code link](https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics/blob/master/PathTracking/move_to_pose/move_to_pose.py)).

Dear AtsushiSakai, <br>WE found your project from google when first searching for a rosbag to csv converter. We are a small team in MCity working on Connected (and Automated) vehicles. We are working with an opensource platform that serve as the AI to control the vehicle. Your code and documentation helped us a lot! <br> <br>Thank you! Have a nice day!

Dear Atsushi Sakai, <br> <br>With your simplistic descriptions in text and as gifs, i was able to help my students understand easily and effectively, I would be honored to help, in anyway towards this, As a hobbyist have been developing lidar based slam navigation systems from 2011 and its only right to acknowledge and thank you for your contributions.

Hi AtsushiSakai, <br> <br>Thanks for creating the pythonrobotics repo! It's an awesome repo that has been of great help to me. I've referenced your extended kalman filter algorithm while creating my own for localization using a 2D lidar, camera, and IMU. Our robot is destined to compete soon, so fingers crossed that all works out! Thanks again.

You rock!

--Matt

Dear Atushi, thank you for this amazing repository. It is a pleasure to have access to python algorithms without the burden of ROS. While I'm no longer working on such robotics projects, it's wonderful to know its available when I need it and it was amazing to see all the beautiful animations for each algorithm.

I've learned the robotics from the traditional way of solving problem through finding packages and reading papers. This amazing project is unbelievably helpful for new-comers to learn and get familiar with the algorithms. Gods know how many hours you've taken to sort all the materials and written everything into one single coherent project. I'm truly amazed and deepest appreciation.

--Ewing Kang

Dear AtsushiSakai, thanks a lot for the PythonRobotics git repository. I'm a college student who is trying to make a mini autonomous robot for my final project submission, I still haven't started using your code but by the look of it I'm sure it will be of greater use. Will let you know how my project is coming up.
