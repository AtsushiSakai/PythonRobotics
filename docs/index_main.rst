Welcome to PythonRobotics's documentation!
==========================================

Python codes for robotics algorithm. The project is on `GitHub`_.

This is a Python code collection of robotics algorithms.

Features:

1. Easy to read for understanding each algorithm's basic idea.

2. Widely used and practical algorithms are selected.

3. Minimum dependency.
