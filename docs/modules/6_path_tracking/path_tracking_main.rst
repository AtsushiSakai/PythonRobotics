Path Tracking
=============

Path tracking is the ability of a robot to follow the reference path generated by a path planner while simultaneously stabilizing the robot. The path tracking controller may need to account for modeling error and other forms of uncertainty. In path tracking, feedback control techniques and optimization based control techniques are widely used[22]. Fig.6 shows simulations using rear wheel feedback steering control and PID speed control, and iterative linear model predictive path tracking control[27].
