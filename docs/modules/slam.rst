Iterative Closest Point (ICP) Matching
--------------------------------------

This is a 2D ICP matching example with singular value decomposition.

It can calculate a rotation matrix and a translation vector between
points to points.

EKF SLAM
--------

This is an Extended Kalman Filter based SLAM example.

The blue line is ground truth, the black line is dead reckoning, the red
line is the estimated trajectory with EKF SLAM.

The green crosses are estimated landmarks.

FastSLAM 2.0
------------

This is a feature based SLAM example using FastSLAM 2.0.

The animation has the same meanings as one of FastSLAM 1.0.

Graph based SLAM
----------------

This is a graph based SLAM example.

The blue line is ground truth.

The black line is dead reckoning.

The red line is the estimated trajectory with Graph based SLAM.

The black stars are landmarks for graph edge generation.
