.. _`Internal Sensors for Robots`:

Internal Sensors for Robots
============================

This project, `PythonRobotics`, focuses on algorithms, so hardware is not included.
However, having basic knowledge of hardware in robotics is also important for understanding algorithms.
Therefore, we will provide an overview.
