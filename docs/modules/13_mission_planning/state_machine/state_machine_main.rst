State Machine
-------------

A state machine is a model used to describe the transitions of an object between different states. It clearly shows how an object changes state based on events and may trigger corresponding actions.

Core Concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **State**: A distinct mode or condition of the system (e.g. "Idle", "Running"). Managed by State class with optional on_enter/on_exit callbacks
- **Event**: A trigger signal that may cause state transitions (e.g. "start", "stop")
- **Transition**: A state change path from source to destination state triggered by an event
- **Action**: An operation executed during transition (before entering new state)
- **Guard**: A precondition that must be satisfied to allow transition

API
~~~

.. autoclass:: MissionPlanning.StateMachine.state_machine.StateMachine
   :members: add_transition, process, register_state
   :special-members: __init__

PlantUML Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``generate_plantuml()`` method creates diagrams showing:

- Current state (marked with [*] arrow)
- All possible transitions
- Guard conditions in [brackets]
- Actions prefixed with /
