Python for Robotics
----------------------

This section explains the Python itself and features for Robotics.

Python for general-purpose programming
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ is an general-purpose programming language developed by
`Guido van Rossum <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum>`_ from the late 1980s.

It features as follows:

#. High-level
#. Interpreted
#. Dynamic type system (also type annotation is supported)
#. Emphasizes code readability
#. Rapid prototyping
#. Batteries included
#. Interoperability for C and Fortran

Due to these features, Python is one of the most popular programming language
for educational purposes for programming beginners.

Python for Scientific Computing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python itself was not designed for scientific computing.
However, scientists quickly recognized its strengths.
For example,

#. High-level and interpreted features enable scientists to focus on their problems without dealing with low-level programming tasks like memory management.
#. Code readability, rapid prototyping, and batteries included features enables scientists who are not professional programmers, to solve their problems easily.
#. The interoperability to wrap C and Fortran libraries enables scientists to access already existed powerful and optimized scientific computing libraries.

To address the more needs of scientific computing, many fundamental scientific computation libraries have been developed based on the upper features.

- `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_ is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- `SciPy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_ is a library that builds on NumPy and provides a large number of functions that operate on NumPy arrays and are useful for different types of scientific and engineering applications.
- `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
- `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source data analysis and data manipulation library built on top of NumPy.
- `SymPy <https://www.sympy.org/>`_ is a Python library for symbolic mathematics.

Also, more domain-specific libraries have been developed based on these fundamental libraries:

- `Scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_ is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.
- `Scikit-image <https://scikit-image.org/>`_ is a collection of algorithms for image processing.
- `Networkx <https://networkx.org/>`_ is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.
- `SunPy <https://sunpy.org/>`_ is a community-developed free and open-source software package for solar physics.
- `Astropy <https://www.astropy.org/>`_ is a community-developed free and open-source software package for astronomy.

Currently, Python is one of the most popular programming languages for scientific computing.

Python for Robotics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Scientific computation routine are very important for robotics.
For example, matrix operation, optimization, and visualization are fundamental for robotics.

Python has become an increasingly popular language in robotics due to its versatility, readability, and extensive libraries. Here's a breakdown of why Python is a great choice for robotics development:

Advantages of Python for Robotics:

Simplicity and Readability: Python's syntax is clear and concise, making it easier to learn and write code. This is crucial in robotics where complex algorithms and control logic are involved.
Extensive Libraries: Python boasts a rich collection of libraries specifically designed for robotics:
ROS (Robot Operating System): ROS, a widely used framework for robotics development, has strong Python support (rospy). This allows developers to easily create nodes, manage communication between different parts of a robot system, and utilize various ROS tools.
OpenCV: This powerful library provides tools for computer vision tasks like image processing, object detection, and motion tracking, essential for robots that perceive and interact with their environment.
NumPy and SciPy: These libraries offer efficient numerical computation and scientific tools, enabling developers to implement complex mathematical models and control algorithms.
Scikit-learn: This library provides machine learning algorithms, which are increasingly important in robotics for tasks like perception, planning, and control.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Python code can run on various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux), providing flexibility in choosing hardware platforms for robotics projects.
Large Community and Support: Python has a vast and active community, offering ample resources, tutorials, and support for developers. This is invaluable when tackling challenges in robotics development.
Use Cases of Python in Robotics:

Robot Control: Python can be used to write control algorithms for robot manipulators, mobile robots, and other robotic systems.
Perception: Python, combined with libraries like OpenCV, enables robots to process sensor data (camera images, lidar data) to understand their surroundings.
Path Planning: Python algorithms can be used to plan collision-free paths for robots to navigate in complex environments.
Machine Learning: Python libraries like Scikit-learn empower robots to learn from data and improve their performance in tasks like object recognition and manipulation.
Simulation: Python can be used to create simulated environments for testing and developing robot algorithms before deploying them on real hardware.
Examples of Python in Robotics:

Autonomous Navigation: Python is used in self-driving cars and other autonomous vehicles for tasks like perception, localization, and path planning.
Industrial Robotics: Python is employed in manufacturing for robot control, quality inspection, and automation.
Service Robotics: Python powers robots that perform tasks like cleaning, delivery, and customer service in various environments.
Research and Education: Python is a popular choice in robotics research and education due to its ease of use and versatility.
Getting Started with Python in Robotics:

Learn Python Basics: Familiarize yourself with Python syntax, data structures, and programming concepts.
Explore Robotics Libraries: Dive into libraries like ROS, OpenCV, and others relevant to your robotics interests.
Practice with Projects: Start with small projects to gain hands-on experience, gradually increasing complexity.
Join the Community: Engage with the robotics community through online forums, workshops, and conferences to learn from others and share your knowledge.
In conclusion, Python's simplicity, extensive libraries, and strong community support make it an ideal language for robotics development. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, Python offers the tools and resources you need to build innovative and capable robots.

Python is used for this `PythonRobotics` project because of the above features
to achieve the purpose of this project described in the :ref:`What is PythonRobotics?`.
