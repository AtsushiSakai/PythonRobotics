Python for general-purpose programming
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ is an general-purpose programming language developed by
`Guido van Rossum <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum>`_ in the late 1980s.

It features as follows:

#. High-level
#. Interpreted
#. Dynamic type system (also type annotation is supported)
#. Emphasizes code readability
#. Rapid prototyping
#. Batteries included
#. Interoperability for C and Fortran

Due to these features, Python is the most popular programming language
for educational purposes for programming beginners.

Python for Scientific Computing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python itself was not designed for scientific computing.
However, scientists quickly recognized its strengths.
For example,

#. High-level and interpreted features enable scientists to focus on their problems without dealing with low-level programming tasks like memory management.
#. Code readability, rapid prototyping, and batteries included features enables scientists who are not professional programmers, to solve their problems easily.
#. The interoperability to wrap C and Fortran libraries enables scientists to access already existed powerful scientific computing libraries.

To address the more needs of scientific computing, many libraries have been developed.

- `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_ is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- `SciPy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_ is a library that builds on NumPy and provides a large number of functions that operate on NumPy arrays and are useful for different types of scientific and engineering applications.
- `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
- `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source data analysis and data manipulation library built on top of NumPy.
- `SymPy <https://www.sympy.org/>`_ is a Python library for symbolic mathematics.

And more domain-specific libraries have been developed:
- `Scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_ is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.
- `Scikit-image <https://scikit-image.org/>`_ is a collection of algorithms for image processing.
