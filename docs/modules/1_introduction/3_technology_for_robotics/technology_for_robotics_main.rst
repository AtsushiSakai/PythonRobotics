Technology for Robotics
-------------------------

An autonomous navigation system is a system that can move to a goal over long
periods of time without any external control by an operator.
The system requires a wide range of technologies:
- It needs to know where it is (localization)
- Where it is safe (mapping)
- Where and how to move (path planning)
- How to control its motion (path following).

The autonomous system would not work correctly if any of these technologies is missing.
