Definition of Robotics
----------------------

What is Robotics?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Robot is a machine that can perform tasks automatically or semi-autonomously.
Robotics is the study of robots.
The field of robotics has wide areas of technologies such as mechanical engineering,
electrical engineering, computer science, and artificial intelligence (AI),
to create machines that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously.

The History of Robots
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This timeline highlights key milestones in the history of robotics:

Ancient and Early Concepts (Before 1500s)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The idea of **automated machines** has existed for thousands of years. Ancient civilizations imagined mechanical beings:

- **Ancient Greece (4th Century BC)** – Greek engineer **Hero of Alexandria** designed early **automata** (self-operating machines) powered by water or air.
- **Chinese and Arabic Automata (9th–13th Century)** – Inventors like **Al-Jazari** created intricate mechanical devices, including water clocks and humanoid robots.

The Birth of Modern Robotics (1500s–1800s)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Leonardo da Vinci’s Robot (1495)** – Designed a humanoid knight with mechanical movement.
- **Jacques de Vaucanson’s Automata (1738)** – Created robotic figures like a mechanical duck that could "eat" and "digest."
- **Industrial Revolution (18th–19th Century)** – Machines began replacing human labor in factories, setting the foundation for automation.

The Rise of Industrial Robots (1900s–1950s)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **The Term “Robot” (1921)** – Czech writer **Karel Čapek** introduced the word *“robot”* in his play *R.U.R. (Rossum’s Universal Robots)*.
- **Early Cybernetics (1940s–1950s)** – Scientists like **Norbert Wiener** developed theories of self-regulating machines, influencing modern robotics.

The Birth of Modern Robotics (1950s–1980s)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **First Industrial Robot (1961)** – *Unimate*, created by **George Devol and Joseph Engelberger**, was the first programmable robot used in a factory.
- **Rise of AI & Autonomous Robots (1970s–1980s)** – Researchers developed mobile robots like **Shakey** (Stanford, 1966) and AI-based control systems.

Advanced Robotics and AI Integration (1990s–Present)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Autonomous Vehicles & Drones** – Self-driving cars and UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) became more advanced.
- **Medical Robotics** – Robots like **da Vinci Surgical System** revolutionized healthcare.
- **Personal Robots** – Devices like **Roomba** (vacuum robot) and **Sophia** (AI humanoid) became popular.
- **Collaborative Robots (Cobots)** – Robots started working alongside humans in industries.

Key Components of Robotics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Robotics consists of several essential components:

#. Sensors – Gather information from the environment (e.g., cameras, LiDAR, gyro, accelerometer, wheel encoders).
#. Actuators – Enable movement and interaction with the world (e.g., motors, hydraulic systems).
#. Computers – Process sensor data and make decisions (e.g., micro-controllers, CPUs, GPUs).
#. Power Supply – Provides energy to run the robot (e.g., batteries, solar power).
#. Software & Algorithms – Allow the robot to function and make intelligent decisions (e.g., ROS, machine learning models, localization, mapping, path planning, control).

This project, PythonRobotics, focuses on the software and algorithms part of robotics.

Applications of Robots
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Robots come in various forms depending on their purpose:

#. 🤖 Industrial Robots – Used in manufacturing (e.g., robotic arms in manufacturing factories).
#. 🏠 Service Robots – Assist in daily life (e.g., vacuum robots, delivery robots).
#. 🚗 Autonomous Vehicles – Self-driving cars and drones.
#. 👨‍⚕️ Medical Robots – Assist in surgeries and healthcare.
#. 🚀 Space & Exploration Robots – Used for planetary exploration (e.g., NASA’s Mars rovers).
#. 🐶 Humanoid & Social Robots – Designed to interact with humans (e.g., ASIMO, Sophia).
