Technologies for Robotics
-------------------------

The field of robotics needs wide areas of technologies such as mechanical engineering,
electrical engineering, computer science, and artificial intelligence (AI).
This project, `PythonRobotics`, only focus on computer science and artificial intelligence.



Autonomous Navigation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In recent years, autonomous navigation technologies have received huge
attention in many fields.
Such fields include, autonomous driving[22], drone flight navigation,
and other transportation systems.

An autonomous navigation system is a system that can move to a goal over long
periods of time without any external control by an operator.
The system requires a wide range of technologies:
- It needs to know where it is (localization)
- Where it is safe (mapping)
- Where and how to move (path planning)
- How to control its motion (path following).

The autonomous system would not work correctly if any of these technologies is missing.
