Arm Navigation
==============

Two joint arm to point control
------------------------------

Two joint arm to a point control simulation.

This is a interactive simulation.

You can set the goal position of the end effector with left-click on the
ploting area.

Check this doc for machematical background: `Jupyter notebook documentation <https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics/blob/master/ArmNavigation/two_joint_arm_to_point_control/Planar_Two_Link_IK.ipynb>`_

N joint arm to point control
----------------------------

N joint arm to a point control simulation.

This is a interactive simulation.

You can set the goal position of the end effector with left-click on the
ploting area.

|n_joints_arm|

In this simulation N = 10, however, you can change it.

Arm navigation with obstacle avoidance
--------------------------------------

Arm navigation with obstacle avoidance simulation.
