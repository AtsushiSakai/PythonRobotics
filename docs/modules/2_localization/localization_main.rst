Localization
============
Localization is the ability of a robot to know its position and orientation with sensors such as Global Navigation Satellite System:GNSS etc. In localization, Bayesian filters such as Kalman filters, histogram filter, and particle filter are widely used[31]. Fig.2 shows localization simulations using histogram filter and particle filter.
