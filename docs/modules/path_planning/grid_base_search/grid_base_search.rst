Grid based search
-----------------

Dijkstra algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a 2D grid based shortest path planning with Dijkstra's
algorithm.

In the animation, cyan points are searched nodes.

.. _a*-algorithm:

A\* algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a 2D grid based shortest path planning with A star algorithm.

.. image:: https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRoboticsGifs/raw/master/PathPlanning/AStar/animation.gif

In the animation, cyan points are searched nodes.

Its heuristic is 2D Euclid distance.

.. _D*-algorithm:

D\* algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a 2D grid based shortest path planning with D star algorithm.

.. image:: https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRoboticsGifs/raw/master/PathPlanning/DStar/animation.gif

The animation shows a robot finding its path avoiding an obstacle using the D* search algorithm.

Potential Field algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a 2D grid based path planning with Potential Field algorithm.

.. image:: https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRoboticsGifs/raw/master/PathPlanning/PotentialFieldPlanning/animation.gif

In the animation, the blue heat map shows potential value on each grid.
