---------------------------

.. image:: https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRoboticsGifs/raw/master/PathPlanning/VisibilityRoadMap/animation.gif

This visibility road-map planner uses Dijkstra method for graph search.

In the animation, the black lines are polygon obstacles,

Red crosses are visibility nodes, and blue lines area collision free visibility graphs.

The red line is the final path searched by dijkstra algorithm frm the visibility graphs.
