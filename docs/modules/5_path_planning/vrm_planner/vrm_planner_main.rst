Voronoi Road-Map planning
-------------------------

.. image:: https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRoboticsGifs/raw/master/PathPlanning/VoronoiRoadMap/animation.gif

This Voronoi road-map planner uses Dijkstra method for graph search.

In the animation, blue points are Voronoi points,

Cyan crosses mean searched points with Dijkstra method,

The red line is the final path of Vornoi Road-Map.
