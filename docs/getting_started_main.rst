üöÄ Getting Started with PythonRobotics
=======================================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Welcome to the PythonRobotics Documentation üëã
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Welcome to PythonRobotics's official documentation, an open source collection of robotics algorithms designed to easily understand the basic ideas behind each algorithm for beginners. 
Let's dive in! üéâ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Introduction to PythonRobotics:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PythonRobotics isn't just about cutting down your effort, it's about understanding and learning. 
It's designed to be a useful resource for budding robotics enthusiasts looking to grasp the fundamental concepts behind each algorithm. 
With its intuitive animations, PythonRobotics simplifies complex concepts, making simulations easily understandable in real-world applications.

Based on the principles of collaboration and knowledge sharing, PythonRobotics is an open source software (OSS).
This project includes a selection of practical algorithms that are widely adopted across academic and industrial domains.

Each algorithm in PythonRobotics is coded in Python 3, one of the most popular and powerful programming languages in the world. 
We invite you to explore, learn, and contribute to our open source community, and look forward to being part of your exciting journey in the world of robotics.
