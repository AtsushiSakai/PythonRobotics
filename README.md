# What is this?

This is a Java code collection of robotics algorithms, especially for autonomous navigation.

Features:

1. Widely used and practical algorithms are selected.

2. Minimum dependency.

3. Easy to read for understanding each algorithm's basic idea.

# Requirements

- Java / Processing


- [cvxpy 0.4.x](http://www.cvxpy.org/en/latest/) 

# How to use

1. Install the required libraries.

2. Clone this repo.

3. Execute Java script in each directory.

4. Add star to this repo if you like it :smiley:.

# Path Planning


## Cubic spline planning

A sample code for cubic path planning.

This code generates a curvature continuous path based on x-y waypoints with cubic spline.

Heading angle of each point can be also calculated analytically.
